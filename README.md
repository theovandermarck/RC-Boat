<h1>RC Boat</h1>
This is code written in Arduino C++ to control an Arduino controlling the rudder of a RC Boat.
The RC boat uses the skeleton of a deconstructed RC car. I hijacked the wires coming from the car's control board that were meant to rotate the wheels, and instead used them as inputs to my Arduino. The Arduino code reads these inputs and translates them into movement of the servo motor controlling the rudder.
